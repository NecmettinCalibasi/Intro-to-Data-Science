Imagine that you are the company Kickstarter: a website for launching and managing crowd-funding campaigns. As Kickstarter, you want to help your customers make campaigns that have a better chance of success, by giving them feedback on the design of their campaigns, before they launch them. You want to do this with the help of machine learning. Your machine learning algorithm determines the chance that a certain unlaunched campaign has of succeeding, based on data on past campaigns' successes and failures. This way, you can tell your customers what their chance of succeeding is if they would launch their campaign now, and potentially you can use the algorithm to deduce factors that could improve their campaign.

Youâ€™ll look at features of the past campaigns, such as: the title, and text body, how long it would be running, and how much money they asked for, and then use any of these features, plus features you derive from them, to train a model.

We have a data set of almost 180.000 campaigns. The data set has mostly (but not completely) been cleaned. Data for 100.000 projects (training set) is provided to you with information of whether the project was completely funded (succeeded) or not. For the remaining 78.065 projects (test set) the funding status is withheld. Your assignment is to train a model that will predict the funding status of the remaining projects.
